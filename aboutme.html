        <h3>Hey there! I am Brandon Wu, a Sophomore from Cupertino High School. At school, I am involved in class council, FBLA, and lincoln-douglas debate. In my community, I started KAST, Kids are Scientists Too, to teach elementary students about STEM concepts. It has been largely successful, signing up over 150 students from two elementary schools. I am interested in pursuing Neuroscience and CS in the future.
